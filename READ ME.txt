Study how wizard and wizard pages are created 
How they are launchied from the code (from your handler)
Don't try to copy the code from our codebase. It's not properly done.

2) Create wizard for view creation.

Please note that these wizards should only allow the user to provide input values. When you press the finish button it should just print the values that are entered by the user.

If you can , please try using Xtend. Java is also ok, we can convert the code to xtend later. So its ok to use Java for now
